# JW-Bruwer-Skripsie-2023
This repository contains the final code for the True Random Number Generator Skripsie done by Johan Bruwer at Stellenbosch University.

In this repository there is the code for the final design named: TRNG_finalCode.
This code file contains the Arduino program that uses radioactive decay and atmospheric
noise to generate truly random numbers. Further detail of how the code operates 
are explained inside the Arduino code file.
